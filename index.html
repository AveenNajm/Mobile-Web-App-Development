         <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>
           A cleft lip is a gap in the upper lip on either one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can vary from a slight notch (an incomplete cleft lip) to a longer gap extending up towards and into the nostril (a complete cleft lip).
           The palate forms the roof of the mouth and normally separates the mouth from the nose. A cleft palate is a gap in the roof of the mouth. This gap may involve the soft palate at the back of the mouth or extend further forward into the bony, hard palate.<br /><br />
           One in every 600 to 700 children is born with a cleft lip and/or palate. Services for these children are provided through the North West, Isle of Man and North Wales Cleft Lip and Palate Network.
           Across the Network, approximately 150 children each year are born with a cleft lip and/or palate and, at any given point in time, ongoing treatment is provided for around 3000 children and adults.
           The Network also sees patients without a cleft but with similar speech difficulties. These referrals are often made by Speech and Language Therapists working in the community.

           <br /><br />The Network also sees patients without a cleft but with similar speech difficulties. These referrals are often made by Speech and Language Therapists working in the community.
           The aim of the Network is to provide multidisciplinary specialised management for at least the first 20 years of life to produce the best outcomes for patients in terms of
           optimal physical function, psychological adjustment and aesthetics.
           The Network ensures that parents are provided with good antenatal and postnatal care and effective surgical treatment where a cleft lip and/or palate has been diagnosed. Surgery to repair the cleft is undertaken at two centres across the Network – Royal Manchester Childrens Hospital and Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Liverpool.
           Surgeons are supported by a highly specialised team of Clinical Nurse Specialists, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Psychologists Geneticists and Audiologists as well as clinicians from Orthodontics, Ear, Nose and Troat, Restorative and Paediatric Dentistry.
           Ongoing out-patient treatment is provided as close to the patient’s home as possible and the Network provides a range of services, not just at the two surgical centres, but also at Preston, Glan Clwyd, Wrexham and Bangor Hospitals where local clinicians work closely with specialist staff from the centres.

        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
        still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
