					<h1><b>Cleft Lip Feeding</b></h1>                      
					<p id="cleft-types-paragraph"> 
						A cleft lip and cleft palate can cause a number of issues, particularly in the first few months after birth, before surgery is done.<br />
						Problems can include:<br />
						difficulty feeding – a baby with a cleft lip and palate may be unable to breastfeed or feed from a normal bottle because they cannot<br />
						form a good seal with their mouth <br />
						<h1> <b> Feeding your baby </b></h1>
						
						Full term babies are born with a natural ability to feed and this applies to most babies born with a cleft. You may have already have planned<br />
						how you would like to feed your baby. Your midwife and Clinical Nurse Specialist will support you in your choice. In order to feed, new-born <br />
						babies suck swallow and breathe in a smooth and coordinated way. Suction is important in both breast and bottle feeding. For babies born with<br />
						a cleft, the gaps in the lip or palate may make it difficult to create a seal and maintain suction. To help your baby to feed, special bottles <br />
						and teats may be necessary along with some adjustments in technique.<br />
						Breast milk is the natural milk for your baby and can be less irritating to the fragile nasal linings of babies born with a cleft palate. Breast <br />
						<br />milk also helps protect babies against stomach upsets, ear and chest infections, diabetes and eczema whilst encouraging general development and growth.<br />
						Alternatively, you may decide to offer your baby a standard infant formula of your choice.<br />
						For babies born with a cleft involving the palate, feeding directly from the breast will be more difficult and you may need to express your milk.<br />
						This can also be the case for babies with a cleft lip only. An exaggerated latch onto the breast may be possible and will be demonstrated to you by your midwife or Clinical Nurse Specialist if deemed appropriate. During the first few days putting the baby to the breast can help establish the flow of milk. You will be offered the loan of an electric breast pump at no cost to yourself for as long as you wish to express milk for a maximum of a year following the birth of your baby.
						<br />

					</p>
					<br />
					<h1><b>Special Feeding Equipment</b></h1>                      
					<p> 
						For babies born with a cleft palate/ cleft lip and palate, and occasionally a cleft lip only, it may be necessary to offer expressed breast milk or infant formula from a cup, syringe, scoop  <br />
						or soft bottle. The soft bottle allows you to give your baby the milk by gently squeezing the sides as he/she suckles. A larger orthodontic latex teat is also often required. The teat sits <br />
						across the cleft in the palate preventing the teat from moving up into the delicate tissue of the nose thus preventing ulcers.<br />
						It maybe that your baby is unable to use a soft bottle during the first few weeks following birth but your clinical nurse specialist will assess your baby’s skills and make a plan with you<br />
						Your clinical nurse specialist will provide your first supply of feeding equipment. Extra feeding bottles and teats can be purchased from CLAPA (Cleft Lip and Palate Association).
