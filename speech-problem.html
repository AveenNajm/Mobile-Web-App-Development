					<h1><b>CLEFT Lip Speech Problems</b></h1>                      
					<p id="cleft-types-paragraph"> 
						Due to the opening of the roof of the mouth and the lip, muscle function may be decreased, which can lead to a delay in speech or abnormal speech. Ask your doctor if consultation with a speech therapist would be right for your child.<br />
						difficulty feeding – a baby with a cleft lip and palate may be unable to breastfeed or feed from a normal bottle because they cannot form a good seal with their mouth <br />
						<h1><b> Early speech development in babies </b></h1>
						Children born with cleft lip and/or palate vary in their speech development. The severity of the cleft does not always indicate the level of difficulty a child will have in developing speech. Many children with cleft lip and/or palate develop normal speech with no need for help from the speech and language therapist.

						However, others may develop speech problems recognised by the speech and language therapist as being related to the cleft. Many of these ‘cleft-type’ speech problems can be corrected with speech therapy.

						It is important not to confuse these abnormal speech patterns with the normal immature sounds many children produce. Children generally tend to grow out of these without any therapy. The therapist often works with the parents to sort out these differences and aims to correct any residual speech difficulties.
						<br />
					</p>
					<br />
					<h1><b>How do we produce speech</b></h1>                      
					<p> 
						We produce speech by air coming from the lungs, through the vocal folds (voice box) and out of the mouth. We shape the sound with our tongue, lips and teeth in order to say sounds and words. The diagrams below show the main parts of the speech mechanism and where sounds are made.

						The palate plays an important role in speech production as it closes off the nose from the mouth during speech.

						Most sounds produced in English are made with the palate raised (with the nose cavity closed off) and these sounds are called ‘oral’ (p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, ch, ge).

						In addition to this there are three sounds (m, n and ng) where the palate is lowered (the connection between the mouth and the nose is open) and these are called ‘nasals’.

						In our centre we aim to prevent the development of abnormal speech patterns. We do this by observing and discussing your baby’s babble sounds with you. If necessary, we advise on how best to encourage the movements and sounds needed for speech. We will also discuss which sounds to discourage.

						Children with cleft lip and/or palate are seen by a speech and language therapist at Great Ormond Street Hospital/St Andrews Centre for a formal speech and language assessment at the age of 18 months and around three years of age, in addition to the routine Cleft Lip and Palate clinic appointments.

						In addition to normal “chatting” with your baby, which is a vital part of language development, parents can play an important role in shaping early sounds. We hope the following ideas are useful. The aim is to develop what your baby is already doing and to encourage further speech sound development.
