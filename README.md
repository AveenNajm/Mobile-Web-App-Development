# Mobile-Web-App-Development
This project focuses on the development of a mobile application for expectant mothers whose babes have been diagnosed with cleft lip and palate. The application aims to bring medical advice closer to the patient by creating a link between the mothers and qualified medical personnel. This application will, therefore, alleviate the anxieties associated with the condition, bearing in mind the fact that there is an increase in the number of sites offering generalized medical advice that may or may not be useful for the management of this condition. The project will, therefore, achieve the following objectives:
1.	Create a simple to use application for with specific information on cleft lip and palate.
2.	Alleviate anxiety in mothers expecting children with this condition by enabling access to the right information on the condition.
3.	Enable a continuous direct link between mothers and doctors before and after birth through dedicated chat lines.
4.	Create a system for the rapid referral of mothers to the right medical expert after a confirmed diagnosis

## Target Audience
The project mainly targets families of babies born with cleft lip and palate. It was specifically aimed at families in the Wales region of the United Kingdom. The application is useful for pregnant mothers between 17 and 21 weeks who have either had a diagnosis or are suspecting that their baby may be at risk. The application is also useful for new mothers, or young infants whose case is manageable through surgery. The application is designed as an information repository for cleft lip and palate. It will, therefore, provide answers to some frequent answers to questions raised by families lining with this condition. Some of the issues addressed by the application are:
1.	What are cleft lip and cleft palate, and what are some of the causes?
2.	Are there any preventative measures?
3.	Does the child need surgery, and if so, when?
4.	What does cleft lip and palate look like before and after surgery?
5.	Why do infants with cleft have difficulties feeding?
6.	What are the best ways to feed a baby with a cleft palate? Although this list is not exhaustive, it contains some of the most typical questions brought forth by parents managing this condition.
